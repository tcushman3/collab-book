# LMC 2700 Project 5

Hey!!! So grab the Project5 folder, it has all the stuff in it.

# Current Features:  
  - drawing ability  
  - color selection  
  - pen size selection  
  - buttons: New Frame, Clear, and Finish (currently does nothing)
  - frame count  
  - moving sidebar   
        -3 menu options: Templates, Add Your Own, and About (I figure for like our names and about the project)   
        -simple modal appears when an option is clicked (although they currently all trigger the same modal)  
  - saves old frames (can be accessed with L and R arrow keys)
      
  
 # TODO:
  - add transparent overlay of last frame to new frame for tracing and have it NOT save with the new image  
  - add sketches as templates  
        -ability to resize/move these sketches  
  - ability to save a sketch to template options  
  - view the entire flipbook in a series once all done  
      - add timing intervals so that it looks like a real flipbook  
 
 # Extra Features (if time permits):  
  - turn.js for final flipbook- it makes the canvas look like a real page  
  - popup modal signalling for the users to switch (this is given that they're working on the same computer)
  
# collab-book
